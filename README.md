This repository contains the data and software associated with the research study:
**"Using Vibration for Secure Pairing with Implantable Medical Devices: Development and Usability Study."**
The core idea of this work is to enable secure and usable pairing between an implantable medical device (IMD) and an external device, such as a smartphone, using vibration signals.

This research involved a user study with human participants. In accordance with approvals granted by the relevant institutional ethics committees, we are making all relevant materials publicly available, including:

- Software in our prototype
	- IMD (Arduino)
	- External device (Arduino)
- Data from user study
